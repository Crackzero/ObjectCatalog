# Landmarks for Object-Based Visual Outdoor Localization Approaches of Automated Ground Vehicles

This page contains several information for the object based localization methods by using landmarks:

* A mindmap for the overview of all proposed attributes for object description, georeferencing for the creation of future datasets.
* A table with objects, attributes and suitability in comparsion of their suitability for object-based localization methods. The suitability is claculated by the object-based norm
